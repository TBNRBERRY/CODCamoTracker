CODCamoTracker

I made this Android app to track my Call of Duty camos and see what I have done and what I need to complete.

What it does:

   • Tracks camo completion for Call of Duty games
   • Helps me keep track of which camos I've unlocked and which ones I still need
   • Provides a quick overview of my progress

How to use:

   • Clone the repository
   • Build and install the Android app
   • Start tracking your Call of Duty camos!

Notes:

   • This is a personal project for my own use
   • Not officially affiliated with Activision or Call of Duty
   • Feel free to fork and modify if you want to use it yourself

Let me know if you have any questions or want to contribute!
